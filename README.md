### Hi there! 👋

I'm John Tur (He/They), a 16 year old student primarily interested in programming languages, compilers, and systems programming.

- 🔨 .NET ecosystem is my prime choice, but enjoy other languages like Modern C++, Rust, Swift, Dart, MLs
- 📝 Interested in languages and compilers — dynamic languages, advanced type systems, optimizing compilers, etc.
- 🧰 Lots of modern Windows programming; experienced with UWP, Windows Runtime internals, and cross-language APIs
- [⚡](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) Love writing & optimizing high-performance code, and adapting high-level languages for safe systems programming


I spend almost all of my online time on Discord and GitHub — I am most most active in these places:

- [C# Discord](aka.ms/csharp-discord)
- [UWP Community Discord](https://aka.ms/winui/discord)
- [.NET Evolution Discord](https://aka.ms/dotnet-discord)
